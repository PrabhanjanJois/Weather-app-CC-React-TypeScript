# <b>1) Contacts Application</b>

This web-based application was developed using PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \
The application has a pleasant user interface and is easy to use. \
The system requires system users' credentials to access the list of the phone books or directories and other features of the application.\
The new user can create a new system account by registering their credentials.
